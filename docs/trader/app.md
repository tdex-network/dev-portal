2. **Perform a Peg-In**: Utilize the seamless peg-in process provided, courtesy of TDEX. Click on the "+" symbol within the app interface, then select "Receive BTC." Send your BTC to the Bitcoin peg-in address displayed. 

3. **Confirmation Await**: After sending your BTC, wait for 102 confirmations on the Bitcoin network, which typically takes about a day.

4. **Claim Your L-BTC**: Once the necessary confirmations are completed, navigate back to the app's homepage. Locate the L-BTC option, click on it, and then refresh the screen. Look for the "CLAIM" button and click on it. Within minutes, you should receive your freshly minted L-BTC in your wallet.

By following these steps, you'll successfully convert your BTC to L-BTC, enabling you to utilize the app seamlessly.
